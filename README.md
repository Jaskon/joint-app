# React + Node.js App

This is a full-stack application built with React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. The app demonstrates a simple setup for a modern web application.

## Features

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, React Router, and SCSS for styling.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js for API handling.
- **Database**: MongoDB (optional, depending on the app's requirements).
- **Tooling**: npm for dependency management, Webpack/Babel for bundling, and ESLint/Prettier for code quality.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm (v8 or higher)
- MongoDB (if using a database)
